## Tools for MT3339 Based GPS

It may seem slightly counter-intuitive, but in order for a GPS unit to produce an accurate fix,
it has to know the time, the location of the GPS satellites, and it's own rough location.
Odd, given that it's job is to tell YOU those things.  Since the satellites broadcast the time and
their positions, the GPS unit can get the info but **it must have a strong signal from 4 satellites 
for about a minute.**  If the signal level drops a little or a satellite goes out of view in that minute,
the GPS unit has to start over again.  Outdoors with a clear view of the sky, this isn't usually
a problem.  Indoors or when the outdoor view is obstructed by trees, terrain, buildings, etc.
it can be impossible to get an initial fix because you just can't get a strong signal from 4 satellites 
for enough time.

"But wait, my cell phone gets a fast fix indoors!".  Yep, and there's a reason for that.  
Being network connected, the phone already knows the exact time and it's rough location as
the cell network provides both.  As for the location of the satellites at any particular time
(the ephemeris data), that's public information and the GPS manufacturers thoughtfully
provide files, usually updated nightly and good for 7, 14 or 30  days, that the phone can download.
The whole process is called Assisted-GPS and doesn't require as strong
a signal to get and maintain a fix.

If you going to use your MT3339 based unit only outdoors, no need to read further.  Otherwise...

The Adafruit Ultimate GPS is based on the GlobalTop PA6H GPS unit which is in turn based on the
MediaTek MT3339 chip.  GlobalTop provides the ephemeris data in the form of an
EPO (Extended Prediction Orbit) file available from their FTP site (see eporetrieve, below).
There are other sources for EPO data, including directly from MediaTek, but there are 2 formats,
EPO and EPO-II. The MT3339 in this applications needs the original EPO format and can handle
only 7 or 14 day files. That's what's on the GlobalTop site.

So now what?  Use the tools...

### Get the EPO file:

#### eporetrieve:  Retrieves the current EPO file from the GlobalTop FTP Server
```
eporetrieve [ <file_name> [ <output_file> ] ]

Example:
# eporetrieve MTK14.EPO /tmp/MTK14.EPO
 
```
This script is just a wrapper around wget.  It's generally best to do this in the morning UTC
to make sure the file is valid for the current time.  If you pull it late in the UTC day, you may
get a file that starts the next day and is not yet valid.

### Inspect the EPO file:

#### epoinfo: Displays information about an EPO file
```
usage: epoinfo [-h] <EPO_File>

Prints EPO file information

positional arguments:
  <EPO_File>  EPO data file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

You can use '@filename' to read arguments from a file.
```
To examine the file /tmp/MTK14.EPO...
```
# epoinfo /tmp/MTK14.EPO

  56 EPO sets.  Valid from 2015-02-16 23:59:46 to 2015-03-02 23:59:46 UTC

```
Each set covers a 6 hour period so for a 14 day file, there should be 56 sets in the file.
For the PA6H, make sure the file is a Type I file and that the "Valid from" span includes
the current time. 

### Load the EPO file to the GPS:

#### epoloader:  Loads an EPO file to the GPS
```
usage: epoloader [-h] [-t yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss | -]
                 [-l lat.dddddd,lon.dddddd,alt]
                 [-s {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}] [-k] [-c]
                 <EPO_File> <gps_device>

Loads EPO data sets to MT3339 GPS

positional arguments:
  <EPO_File>            EPO File or '-' to just set the known parameters
  <gps_device>          GPS serial device such as '/dev/ttyUSB0'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}, --speed {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}
                        Interface speed
  -k, --keep-new-speed  Don't restore the old speed on exit
  -c, --clear           Clears the existing EPO data from the unit

optional known time and location parameters:
  -t yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss | - , --time yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss | - 
                        Current UTC or UTC from host
  -l lat.dddddd,lon.dddddd,alt, --location lat.dddddd,lon.dddddd,alt
                        Current location specified in decimal degrees and
                        meters

You can use '@filename' to read arguments from a file.
```

Before you start this step, make sure you're unit is connected and that the port speed
matches the GPS speed.  You can use the gpsinit utility (see below) to do this.
If you can 'cat' the port where the GPS is connected and get valid NMEA data,
you should be OK.
```
# ## Set the port to raw mode first
# stty -F /dev/tty<something> raw
# cat /dev/tty<something>
$GPGGA,000221.000,3899.0037,N,10499.9070,W,1,10,1.01,1795.4,M,-20.7,M,,*6C
$GPGLL,3899.0037,N,10499.9070,W,000221.000,A,A*4E
$GPRMC,000221.000,A,3899.0037,N,10499.9070,W,0.16,224.89,180215,,,A*74
$GPVTG,224.89,T,,M,0.16,N,0.30,K,A*3C
$GPZDA,000221.000,18,02,2015,,*5A
```

If your unit is at factory state or it's time and last known location are off significantly, 
you'll need to supply your location and the time in addition to the EPO file.
If you're unit already has a fix and you just need to update EPO data, you don't need to
supply the location and time.  

You location and altitude must be specified in decimal degrees, using negative numbers for West and South,
and meters. Google Earth is a good source.  The more accurate the better but the location needs to be within 30km.

For the time, just let epoloader get it from your host system using the '-t-' option, assuming it's
accurate.  If not, specify it as shown above in UTC.

Since you can specify options to epoloader in a file, you may want to create a file
that has the location and time options in it.  For instance, if you're on the lawn
outside the Washington Monument...
```
echo "-l 38.889468,-77.352420,5 -t-" > epoloader.conf
```
Finally a last word on port speed.  By now you've already made sure that the port
speed and the unit speed match.  If the unit is at factory state, it's probably
at 9600 baud which is just a touch slow.  By supplying the '-s' option to epoloader,
you can specify the speed to use for the load and the program will take care of 
setting both the unit and the port to the correct speed, then resetting both to their
original speed on completion.  Use 115200 (the default) unless you have a flaky setup.  You can also
specify the '-k' option to leave the unit and port at the new speed.

NOTE:  It's pretty much impossible to mess up the GPS unit with this process as it doesn't touch
the unit's firmware.  If you get into a bad communications state, just try again, use gpsinit, 
try holding the EN signal low for a second, or remove the
power and battery for a few seconds to reset back to factory state.    

Now you're ready.  Assuming your location and time is in epoloader.conf, the EPO file is
/tmp/MTK14.EPO, your device is connected to /dev/ttyUSB1 and you want to use the default 115200 speed, then...
```
# epoloader @epoloader.conf /tmp/MTK14.EPO /dev/ttyUSB1

```
At 115200, the process should take about 17 seconds.  If you didn't specify the '-k' option,
the unit and the port will be returned to their previous speed. 

### Does it make a difference??

Oh yes...  Look at the times for Factory Reset.  The difference is amazing.

### gpsinit:  Initializes GPS configuration
```
usage: gpsinit [-h] [-s {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}]
               [-i <init_command> | -f <command_file>]
               <gps_device>

Initialized GPS to known state

positional arguments:
  <gps_device>          GPS serial device such as '/dev/ttyUSB0'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}, --speed {4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200}
                        Interface speed
  -i <init_command>, --init_command <init_command>
                        A single initialization command such as 'PMTK101'
  -f <command_file>, --command_file <command_file>
                        A file containing commands used to initialize the GPS

You can use '@filename' to read arguments from a file.
```
gpsinit can help get the GPS unit to a known state.  It will attempt to get the port
and GPS unit to the same speed, then send commands of your choosing to set update rate,
enable/disable NMEA sentences, etc.  You can specify the desired speed and a single command on the
command line with the '-i' and '-s' options or the speed and a list of commands in a file specified
by the '-f' option.  

This is an example gpsinit_reset.conf that clears the NVRAM, does a factory reset, sets some defaults,
sets NMEA sentences and frequency and finally does an epo load.
```
# You can use the following variables in this file...
#  ${SPEED}
#  ${DEVICE}
#
#  The following commands are recognized...
#
#  sleep <seconds>				Sleep for n.nnn seconds
#  setspeed <newspeed>			Set new port and unit speed to <newspeed>
#  epoloader <epoloader_args>   Run epoloader
#  factory_reset				Clear system/user configurations then cold start
#                               	The unit and port speed will be reset to 9600

#  The following commands can be prefixed with '-' to not wait for an ACK.
#  hot_start					Restart using all available data
#  warm_start					Don't use Ephemeris at restart
#  cold_start					Don't use Time, Position, Almanacs and Ephemeris
#									data at re‐start
#  PMTKnnn,<args>               Send the specified PMTK command
#

# Clear the EPO NVRAM
PMTK127
# Factory reset (don't wait for ACK)
factory_reset
# Now set to 115200
setspeed 115200
# Set DGPS mode to SBAS
PMTK301,2
# Set SBAS Enabled
PMTK313,1
# Set NMEA Sentence Output
PMTK314,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
# Set SBAS 'Integrity' Mode
PMTK319,1
# Disable Periodic Mode
PMTK225,0
# Enable AIC Mode
PMTK286,1
# Enable EASY Mode
PMTK869,1,1
# Set output rate to 1 second
PMTK220,1000
# Load the EPO. 
epoloader -c -s ${SPEED} @gpsinit_loc.conf /tmp/MTK14.EPO ${DEVICE}

# You shouldn't put anything after the epolaoder.
#  It can interfere with the unit getting it's initlal fix.
```
```
# gpsinit -f gpsinit_reset.conf /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### gpssend:  Sends a single command to the GPS
```
gpssend <command_string> <gps_device>

Example:
# ## Send a Hot Start command to the GPS unit
# gpssend PMTK101 /dev/ttyUSB0
# ##  Writes '$PMTK101*32\r\n'

```
Sometimes you just want to send a single command to the GPS unit but having to calculate the 
required checksum is a pain.  gpssend is a simple shell script that does the calculation for
you and writes the result to the GPS device.

###gpsstatus:  Continuously displays simple GPS output
```
gpsstatus <gps_device>
```	
This shell script just displays the output of the GPS unit and calculates the time to first fix.
